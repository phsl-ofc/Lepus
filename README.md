# Lepus

**Lepus** is a tool for enumerating subdomains, checking for subdomain takeovers and perform port scans - and boy, is it fast!

#### Basic Usage

```
lepus.py yahoo.com
```

## Summary
* [Enumeration modes](#Enumeration-modes)
* [Subdomain Takeover](#Subdomain-Takeover)
* [Port Scan](#Port-Scan)
* [Installation](#Installation)
* [Arguments](#Arguments)


## Enumeration modes
The enumeration modes are different ways lepus uses to identify sudomains for a given domain. These modes are:

* [Collectors](#Collectors)
* [Dictionary](#Dictionary)
* [Permutations](#Permutations)
* [Expand](#Expand)
* [Enrich](#Enrich)
* [Reverse DNS](#ReverseDNS)
* [Markov](#Markov)
* [ChatGPT](#ChatGPT)
* [Regulator](#Regulator)

Moreover:
* For all methods, lepus checks if the given domain or any generated potential subdomain is a *wildcard* domain or not.
* After identification, lepus collects ASN and network information for the identified domains that resolve to public IP Addresses.


### Collectors
The Collectors mode collects subdomains from the following services:

You can add your API keys in the `config.ini` file.

The Collectors module will run by default on lepus. If you do not want to use the collectors during a lepus run (so that you don't exhaust your API key limits), you can use the `-nc` or `--no-collectors` argument.

### Proxy
Some services work with proxy server and can help limit requests. To configure, just go to the `config.ini` file and configure the data. It can be fixed or rotating, with or without username and password.

### Brute Force Wordlist
Now it is possible to use wordlist and add to the database only those that are actually online, to do this simply configure the size you want, thread and timeout in `config.ini`, for more information on the size of the list simply access this repository:

```
https://github.com/n0kovo/n0kovo_subdomains
```

### Dictionary
The dictionary mode can be used when you want to provide lepus a list of subdomains. You can use the `-w` or `--wordlist` argument followed by the file. A custom list comes with lepus located at `lists/subdomains.txt`. An example run would be:

```
lepus.py -w lists/subdomains.txt yahoo.com
```

### Permutations
The Permutations mode performs changes on the list of subdomains that have been identified. For each subdomain, a number of permutations will take place based on the `lists/words.txt` file. You can also provide a custom wordlist for permutations with the `-pw` or `--permutation-wordlist` argument, followed by the file name. An example run would be:

```
lepus.py --permutate yahoo.com
```

or

```
lepus.py --permutate -pw customsubdomains.txt yahoo.com
```

### Expand
The expansion mode performs brute-force of subdomains similar to the dictionary mode, but on subdomains of the root. For instance considering the following already identified findings:

```
dev.test.example.com
qa.test.example.com
```

In such a case, with a default depth of 1, Lepus would use a dictionary against `test.example.com`. You can use the `-ed` or `--expand-depth` to control the depth of subdomains to brute-force. Moreover, the wordlist to use can be changed with the `-ew` or `--expand-wordlist` flag. An example run would be:

```
lepus.py --expand yahoo.com
```

or

```
lepus.py --expand yahoo.com -ed 2 -ew lists/subdomains-top5000.txt
```

### Enrich
The enrichment mode identifies strings in already identified subdomains and uses these as an input wordlist similarly to the previously mentioned permutations module. Using the flag `-el` or `--enrich-length` the minimum length of the strings extracted can be changed from the default value of 2. An example run of this module would be:

```
lepus.py --enrich yahoo.com
```

or

```
lepus.py --enrich yahoo.com -el 3
```

### ReverseDNS
The ReverseDNS mode will gather all IP addresses that were resolved and perform a reverse DNS on each one in order to detect more subdomains. For example, if `www.example.com` resolves to `1.2.3.4`, lepus will perform a reverse DNS for `1.2.3.4` and gather any other subdomains belonging to `example.com`, e.g. `www2`,`internal` or `oldsite`.

To run the ReverseDNS module use the `--reverse` argument. Additionally, `--ripe` (or `-ripe`) can be used in order to instruct the module to query the RIPE database using the second level domain for potential network ranges. Moreover, lepus supports the `--ranges` (or `-r`) argument. You can use it to make reverse DNS resolutions against CIDRs that belong to the target domain.

By default this module will take into account all previously identified IPs, then defined ranges, then ranges identified through the RIPE database. In case you only want to run the module against specific or RIPE identified ranges, and not against all already identified IPs, you can use the `--only-ranges` (`-or`) argument.

An example run would be:

```
lepus.py --reverse yahoo.com
```

or

```
lepus.py --reverse -ripe -r 172.216.0.0/16,183.177.80.0/23 yahoo.com
```

or only against the defined or identified from RIPE

```
lepus.py --reverse -or -ripe -r 172.216.0.0/16,183.177.80.0/23 yahoo.com
```

Hint: lepus will identify `ASNs` and `Networks` during enumeration, so you can also use these ranges to identify more subdomains with a subsequent run.

### Markov
With this module, Lepus will utilize Markov chains in order to train itself and then generate subdomain based on the already known ones. The bigger the general surface, the better the tool will be able to train itself and subsequently, the better the results will be.

The module can be activated with the `--markovify` argument. Parameters also include the Markov state size, the maximum length of the generated candidate addition, and the quantity of generated candidates. Predefined values are 3, 5 and 5 respectively. Those arguments can be changed with `-ms` (`--markov-state`), `-ml` (`--markov-length`) and `-mq` (`--markov-quantity`) to meet your needs. Keep in mind that the larger these values are, the more time Lepus will need to generate the candidates.

It has to be noted that different executions of this module might generate different candidates, so feel free to run it a few times consecutively. Keep in mind that the higher the `-ms`, `-ml` and `-mq` values, the more time will be needed for candidate generation.

```
lepus.py --markovify yahoo.com
```

or

```
lepus.py --markovify -ms 5 -ml 10 -mq 10
```

### ChatGPT
By enabling this module with the `--gpt` argument, Lepus will utilize OpenAI's ChatGPT in order to generate more subdomains. By default, the prompt looks like the following:

```
Please generate 100 subdomains similar to <list of 10 subdomains already identified>"
```

You can use `-gg` (`--gpt-give`) and `-gr` (`--gpt-receive`) to control the ammount of subdomains you either ask for in each query, or the ammount of hostnames you provide it with. Moreover, `-gc` or `--gpt-concurrent` can be used to control concurrent queries made, and `-gl` or `--gpt-loop` can be used to loop over the same query more than once. An example run would be the following:

```
lepus.py --gpt yahoo.com
```

or

```
lepus.py --gpt yahoo.com -gg 10 -gr 200 -gc 8 -gl 4
```

### Regulator
This module's goal is to be able to automagically learn regexes that capture idiosyncratic features of observed DNS data. Using these learned patterns, Lepus will attempt to synthesize new subdomains that follow the same language patterns. This module utilizes the power of regular language ranking via the `dank` (https://github.com/cramppet/dank) library.

The module can be enabled with the `--regulate` flag. Moreover, the following additional flags can be provided to fine-tune the parameters and execution if needed:

* `-rt` or `--reg-threshold` 
* `-rmr` or `--reg-max-ratio`
* `-rml` or `--reg-max-length`
* `-rdl` or `--reg-dist-low`
* `-rdh` or `--reg-dist-high`

The module is a port of `Regulator` (https://github.com/cramppet/regulator) and more information can be found on the author's blog (https://cramppet.github.io/regulator/index.html).

An example exeuction of this module would be like the following:

```
lepus.py --regulate yahoo.com
```

or

```
lepus.py --regulate yahoo.com -rt 500 -rmr 25 -rml 1000 -rdl 2 -rdh 10
```

### Subdomain Takeover
Lepus has a list of signatures in order to identify if a domain can be taken over. You can use it by providing the `--takeover` argument. This module also supports Slack notifications, once a potential takeover has been identified, by adding a Slack token in the `config.ini` file. The checks are made against the following services:

* Acquia
* Activecampaign
* Aftership

```

or
